## üåü Introduction
The **Lung Cancer Predictor** is a machine learning-based application designed to predict the likelihood of lung cancer based on various health-related features. This project consists of:
- A **FastAPI backend** that serves a machine learning model for predictions.
- A **Flutter frontend** that allows users to input their health data and view predictions.

üìå **Source**: The dataset is derived from Kaggle. Dataset link: [[Lung Cancer Predict Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shantanugarg274/lung-cancer-prediction-dataset)].

This project aims to provide an easy-to-use tool for individuals to assess their risk of lung cancer based on key health indicators.

## üöÄ Features
- **FastAPI Backend**:
  - RESTful API endpoint for making predictions.
  - Input validation using Pydantic.
  - Hosted on Render for public access.
- **Flutter Frontend**:
  - User-friendly interface for inputting health data.
  - Displays prediction results or error messages.
  - Supports multiple pages for input and results.
- **Machine Learning Model**:
  - Trained on a dataset with multiple health-related features.
  - Predicts the likelihood of lung cancer (binary classification).

## üß† How It Works
1. **Data Collection**:
   - The model is trained on a dataset containing features such as age, gender, smoking status, oxygen saturation, and more.
2. **Model Training**:
   - A linear regression model is trained to predict the likelihood of lung cancer.
3. **API Deployment**:
   - The trained model is serialized and integrated into a FastAPI backend.
4. **User Interaction**:
   - Users input their health data into the Flutter app.
   - The app sends the data to the FastAPI endpoint.
   - The API returns the prediction, which is displayed in the app.

## üîó API Endpoint
The FastAPI backend provides a single endpoint for making predictions:

- **URL**: `(https://linear-regression-model-ntlf.onrender.com)`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Input**: JSON object with the following fields:
  ```json
  {
    "AGE": 45,
    "GENDER": 1,
    "SMOKING": 0,
    "FINGER_DISCOLORATION": 0,
    "MENTAL_STRESS": 1,
    "EXPOSURE_TO_POLLUTION": 0,
    "LONG_TERM_ILLNESS": 0,
    "ENERGY_LEVEL": 7.5,
    "IMMUNE_WEAKNESS": 0,
    "BREATHING_ISSUE": 0,
    "ALCOHOL_CONSUMPTION": 1,
    "THROAT_DISCOMFORT": 0,
    "OXYGEN_SATURATION": 98.0,
    "CHEST_TIGHTNESS": 0,
    "FAMILY_HISTORY": 0,
    "SMOKING_FAMILY_HISTORY": 0,
    "STRESS_IMMUNE": 0
  }
  ```
- **Output**: JSON object with the prediction:
  ```json
  {
    "prediction": No Lung Cancer(0)
  }
  ```

## üì± Flutter App
The Flutter app provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the API. It includes:
- **Input Page**:
  - TextFields for each input variable.
  - A "Predict" button to submit the data.
- **Result Page**:
  - Displays the prediction result or an error message.
